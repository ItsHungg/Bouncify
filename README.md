#### Run with a zipped file:

* First, you need to have a Python IDE installed to run the application. You can download the
  IDE [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
* Then, you need to install `pip` (Python Package Installer). You can read the tutorial to
  download `pip` [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).<br>
* After that, you need to install these libraries: **[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)**.<br>

Type in the command prompt:

```
pip install <library>
```

* After doing all the setup steps, this is how you can open and run the application file.

> 1. After downloading a `.rar` or `.zip` file, unzip and open it.
> 2. You will see a folder named **`Bouncify-{branch}`**. Open that folder.
> 3. Open **`Bouncify.py`**. You will see a loading window with a progress bar and a black terminal.
> 4. After the loading & initialization is finished, you'll see the main application window.
